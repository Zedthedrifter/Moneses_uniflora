I suspect the Swiss one is the best option for a de novo assembly and subsequent mining of microsat loci, and maybe a second assembly using the Norway sample will provide a comparison to give in initial assessment of whether any loci we find might be variable.

There are also three more NGS datasets on Genbank for this species, but probably less useful for our purposes as two are hybrid capture experiments using the Angiosperm 353 probe set and one is transcriptome sequencing.
